    The purpose of the level "Dungeon" is to make it to the bottom left corner 
    and find the final chest, which will illuminate the entire level.
    
    After doing so, it will take you to the End Credits which has the game's 
    title, and the lead designer's name.
    
    A game over is achieved either when the player's health falls to 0 or if
    LUMO's, the fire sprite, health fallse below zero, i.e. you no longer have 
    visibility of the level.
